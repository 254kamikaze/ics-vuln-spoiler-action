## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Please report security vulnerabilities via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the **Security** tab
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Provide details about the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Resolution:** Depends on severity

## Responsible Use

This action is designed for **defensive security research**:

### Acceptable Use
- Monitoring your own dependencies
- Security research with authorization
- Improving organizational security

### Unacceptable Use
- Exploiting vulnerabilities before disclosure
- Malicious use of detected vulnerabilities
- Harassing maintainers

## Security Best Practices

1. Store `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in GitHub Secrets only
2. Use minimal required permissions
3. Review alerts carefully - AI may have false positives
